Hello! I am currently a PhD student in the [CS theory group](https://theory.cs.northwestern.edu/) in Northwestern University, where I am advised by [Prof Samir Khuller](https://www.samirkhuller.com/) and co-advised by [Prof Varun Gupta](https://www.varungupta.info/) and [Prof Gruia Calinescu](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~calinesc/). 
Before joining Northwestern, I worked as a research assistant in Nanyang Technological University, advised by [Prof Tang Xueyan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asxytang/). 
I got my Bachelor's degreee in Applied Mathematics from National University of Singapore. 

I am interested in the worst-case theory of scheduling problems arising from the context of classical computer systems and cloud computing. I have been working on their online and offline settings with an emphasis on algorithm design and analysis. For the offline settings, I would generalize some simple models in $\mathbf{P}$ and determine the computational complexity of the generalized model ($\mathbf{P}$ or $\mathbf{NP}$). For those which have been identified to be $\mathbf{NP}$-hard, my goal is to devise polynomial time algorithms with lower approximation ratio. For the online settings, I have been working on decreasing the gap between the lower and upper bounds of the competitiveness of some previously studied models in the deterministic or randomized setting. The other option for online settings is to generalize the scheduling model in the context of machine learning and find the asymptotically tight competitive online algorithm even in the deterministic setting. Beyond the scheduling problems, I am interested in math, such as stochastic processes, integer programming, linear algebra, and etc.
