Hello! I am currently a PhD student in Northwestern University, where I am advised by [Prof Samir Khuller](https://www.samirkhuller.com/) and co-advised by [Prof Varun Gupta](https://www.varungupta.info/) and [Prof Gruia Calinescu](http://www.cs.iit.edu/~calinesc/). 
Before joining Northwestern, I was advised by [Prof Tang Xueyan](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/asxytang/) as a research assistant. 
I got my Bachelor's degreee in Applied Mathematics from National University of Singapore.
